Hello everyone, welcome to blog post for the sixth week.

I started this week by working on `get_command` intrinsic. Since this is not a straight forward function, I planned to create a proof of concept for this function, by implementing this function on a local project and then on adding this function to our codebase. Will working on the POC I was not able to find a general solution to these functions. This function has different implementation for windows environment, linux or unix. Also I figured out that this function is similar to the main function of c++ with input parameter wherein the commands provided in the CLI would be stored.

Then I started working on addition of tests for `sinh`, `cosh` and `tanh` intrinsic function. Then I worked on updation of tests for `sind`, `cosd` and `tand` intrinsic functions. Also I worked on addition of tests for `shiftl`, `lshift`, `shiftr` and `rshift` intrinsics.

Then I worked on implementing `compiler_version` inquiry function. The approached that I used for to add this function to the ISO_ENV file and which can be imported from this particular file. 

Then I worked on addition of tests for `maskl` and `maskr` intrinsic functions. On this stage I found some bug present in maskl intrinsic. This function was unable to handle 32-bit compile time tests. I workedon fixing this bug. Then I worked on addition of tests for `asinh`, `acosh` and `atanh` intrinsic. 

Then I worked on implementation of `random_init` subroutine. To implement this I started with understanding the preimplemented `random_number` subroutine. I was blocked while implementing this function, the blocker was how to utilize the generated seed by `random_init` subroutine in `random_number` subroutine. 

Following are the list of PRs for this week:

1) #[4394](https://github.com/lfortran/lfortran/pull/4394)
2) #[4395](https://github.com/lfortran/lfortran/pull/4395)
3) #[4396](https://github.com/lfortran/lfortran/pull/4396)
4) #[4421](https://github.com/lfortran/lfortran/pull/4421)
5) #[4422](https://github.com/lfortran/lfortran/pull/4422)
6) #[4418](https://github.com/lfortran/lfortran/pull/4418)
7) #[4419](https://github.com/lfortran/lfortran/pull/4419)

For the next week, I would work on addition of tests for remaining intrinsics and resolve issues if I found any on updation of the tests. I would continue to try the `random_init` and `get_command` subroutines.

I would like to thank #[Ondrej Certik](https://github.com/certik) and all the co-mentors for there valuable suggestions and constant support.

Thank you for reading, and I look forward to sharing more updates on my progress soon!
