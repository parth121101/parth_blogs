Hello everyone, welcome to my blog post. This week marked the beginning of the coding phase of my GSoC 2024 journey, and I immersed myself in implementing various intrinsic Fortran functions.

Firstly, I added the `derf` and `derfc` functions by mapping them to the existing `erf` and `erfc` functions. I also refactored the unary intrinsic functions by removing the manually written `create` and `verify` functions and registering them to the Python script to automatically generate these functions. Following this, I completed the refactoring of trigonometric functions such as `sin`, `asin`, `asinh`, and `sinh`, applying similar modifications.

Next, I worked on the implementation of the `dshiftr` intrinsic function from scratch. Although the runtime implementation has some issues, I addressed these by applying suggestions provided by Ubaid. I then implemented the `lgamma`, `algama`, and `dlgama` intrinsic functions from scratch. However, after some discussion, it was decided to map these to the existing `gamma` function, tough there still an issue regarding their elemental behaviour persist.

I also worked on the implementation of the `logical` intrinsic function from scratch. Later, I was advised to add an ASR node for this function instead. Following this suggestion, I removed the initial implementation and added an ASR node accordingly. Additionally, I refactored the `exp`, `atan2`, `fix`, `exp2`, and `expm1` intrinsic functions by using a Python script to generate the create and verify functions automatically, thereby eliminating the manually implemented versions.

Towards the end of the week, I began implementing the `int` intrinsic function from scratch, although this effort still has many issues to resolve.

Following are the list of PRs for this week:

1) #[4014](https://github.com/lfortran/lfortran/pull/4014)
2) #[4055](https://github.com/lfortran/lfortran/pull/4055)
3) #[4076](https://github.com/lfortran/lfortran/pull/4076)
4) #[4046](https://github.com/lfortran/lfortran/pull/4046)
5) #[4066](https://github.com/lfortran/lfortran/pull/4066)
6) #[4087](https://github.com/lfortran/lfortran/pull/4087)
7) #[4092](https://github.com/lfortran/lfortran/pull/4092) 

For the next week, I would work on completion of the runtime implementation of `dshiftr` intrinsic function. Then I would work upon completing the `int` intrinsic functions. Then there are still some functions that are missing, I would work on adding them. Then I even have a plan to go through all the tests for all intrinsic functions and check if the tests incorporates compile time, runtime, compile time with arrays and runtime with arrays test. If any of them would be missing I would work on addition of them.

I would like to thank #[Ondrej Certik](https://github.com/certik) and all the co-mentors for there valuable suggestions.

Thank you for reading, and I look forward to sharing more updates on my progress soon!
