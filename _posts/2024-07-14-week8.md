Hello everyone, welcome to blog post for the seventh and eighth week.

I started this week with working on compiler options intrinsic. I was unable to find how can we implement this function, thanks to Pranav for helping me out in this case. He suggested me a way that can be used to implement it. Then worked on adding non standard intrinsics by adding a compiler flag --std. Initial plan was to set the use of this functions on by default. Later I was suggested to keep them off. 

Then I started working on implementation of random_init intrinsic function. Tough this function was a bit tricky to implement, I figured out a way to do this. I tried to setup the seed in such a way that the random number generated matches with the number that gfortran returns. But it was not possible to find the state of the seed that gfortran uses to generate its own set of random numbers.Added tests to check its correctness and finally my implementation was accepted by my mentors.

Then I worked on addition of integration tests for intrinsic like `log_gamma`, `dgamma`, `gamma` and `log10`. While adding them my test file fails to clear the fortran backend test. I would be working to fix this issue.

Then I worked on adding the optional argument `size` for intrinsic `ishftc`. Added tests for checking if the implementation is correct or not. Along with this I am also working on adding the subroutine `get_command`.



Following are the list of PRs for this week:

1) #[4449](https://github.com/lfortran/lfortran/pull/4449)
2) #[4451](https://github.com/lfortran/lfortran/pull/4451)
3) #[4478](https://github.com/lfortran/lfortran/pull/4478)
4) #[4491](https://github.com/lfortran/lfortran/pull/4491)
5) #[4454](https://github.com/lfortran/lfortran/pull/4454)
6) #[4476](https://github.com/lfortran/lfortran/pull/4476)

For the next week, I would work on addition of tests for remaining intrinsics and resolve issues if I found any on updation of the tests. Then I would continue to work on implementation of remaining subroutines. Then I would work on completing the `int` intrinsic, since we have IntegerBoz support now (Thanks to Pranav again), along with addition of tests for those functions that supports Boz constants. Then I plan to work on adding runtime implementation for `ishftc` intrinsic along with adding error messages for those functions whose runtime implementation are missing like `nearest` and `spacing`.

I would like to thank #[Ondrej Certik](https://github.com/certik) and all the co-mentors for there valuable suggestions and constant support.

Thank you for reading, and I look forward to sharing more updates on my progress soon!
