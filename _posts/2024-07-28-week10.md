Hello everyone, welcome to blog post for the ninth and tenth week.

I started the week with working on addition of optional argument for ishftc intrinsic. Then I worked on addition of intrgration tests for log_gamma and dgamma intrinsic. Then I checked if runtime implementation of nearest and spacing is implemented or not, if not do we have right error message provided for this. 

Then I worked on re implementing `int` intrinsic function. Tough my implementation have a lot of issues left that needs to be resolved before this function is fully implemented.

Then I worked on addition of runtime implementation for `ishftc` intrinsic. There were some checks that are failing in linux env, I would work on fixing them. 

Also I worked on implementation of `get_command` intrinsic.

Following are the list of PRs for this week:

1) #[4186](https://github.com/lfortran/lfortran/pull/4186)
2) #[4491](https://github.com/lfortran/lfortran/pull/4491)
3) #[4525](https://github.com/lfortran/lfortran/pull/4525)
4) #[4533](https://github.com/lfortran/lfortran/pull/4533)
5) #[4526](https://github.com/lfortran/lfortran/pull/4526)
6) #[4478](https://github.com/lfortran/lfortran/pull/4476)

For the next week, I plan to continue my work on addition of get_command intrinsic, then I would continue to complete the PR for runtime implementation of ishftc intrinsic. Then I would work on addition of integration tests of all kind for the remaining intrinsic functions.

I would like to thank #[Ondrej Certik](https://github.com/certik) and all the co-mentors for there valuable suggestions and constant support.

Thank you for reading, and I look forward to sharing more updates on my progress soon!
