Hello everyone, welcome to blog post for the fourth and fifth week.

I started my fourth week with completing the `cshift` intrinsic where the input argument use to change at the end of the evaluation of the function. Later, I worked on addition of error message for the leftover coarrays. Now we have an explicit error message for each of the coarrays.

Then I worked on completing the `eoshift` intrinsic wherein the integration tests use to fail on addition of fortran label. I worked on fixing this issue. All the different input arguments for `eoshift` intrinsic (single and double precision for real, logical and character) were added, except the character type with an uncertain type.

Then I worked on addition of `compiler_version` function. I had an idea of addition of this function by modifying ISO_ENV_LFORTRAN file, tough this was not the appropriate way to handle this. I worked on implementing this tough I didn't succeed at this point of time.

Then I started to study the codebase where the subroutines have been implemented. This was necessary since different pending subroutines were still pending. Then I worked on updating the tests for `floor` and `ceil` intrinsic. Since this files have attached fortran label, the addition of robust tests failed. I worked on fixing this issue tough it didnt worked. Hence I was suggested to create new test files for the addition of this tests and to create new issues for the same. Hence, I worked on creation of new test files for this function.

Then I worked on cleaning up the codebase where all the intrinsic functions have been implemented by removal of unnecessary code. I worked on removal of `verify_args` and `create` function for binary_intrinsic. There was only one function named `Atan2` which was using the namespace `binary_intrinsic`. I worked on removal of this namespace and tried to implement `Atan2` in a way that it aligns the rest of the intrinsics in terms of their implementations. 

Also I looked around for some of the preimplemented intrinsic and checked if they have been implemented correctly and no tried to see if no issues are remaining. I found some issues wherein some of the intrinsics have some conditions for their input arguments. At this point of time we are throwing errors in `eval` and `instantiate` functions. If we can modify this and if we add this checks at `verify_args` or `create` functions then it would be better. I would discuss this with my mentor and if required will work on finding the solution and fixing it. 

Then I worked on addition of tests of all kind for some of the intrinsic functions. They are: `asin`, `acos`, `atan`, `asind`, `acosd`, `atand` and `dprod`. Then I worked on addition of error tests for compile time and runtime for `merge_bits` intrinsic. 

Following are the list of PRs for this week:

1) #[4195](https://github.com/lfortran/lfortran/pull/4195)
2) #[4201](https://github.com/lfortran/lfortran/pull/4201)

10) #[4370](https://github.com/lfortran/lfortran/pull/4370)


For the next week, I would work on addition of tests for remaining intrinsics and resolve issues if I found any on updation of the tests. Then I would work on addition of optional arguments as discussed with Harshita and then would work on addition of the remaining intrinsics.

I would like to thank #[Ondrej Certik](https://github.com/certik) and all the co-mentors for there valuable suggestions and constant support.

Thank you for reading, and I look forward to sharing more updates on my progress soon!
